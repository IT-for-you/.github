## Hi there, we build IT for you 👋

🙋‍♀️ We are a small software agency located in Frankfurt/Main, Germany. We develop professional websites, shops, community pages and any sort of web-based applications and plugins. Most importantly, we appreciate the art of hand-crafting native full stack applications using our favorite technologies.

🌈 Not only are we diverse in gender, we use a wide array of different tools to efficiently manage the work we do. Some of our favorites include:
- Any JetBrains IDE to unleash our programming talent (thank god for their incredible features)
- Asana and Trello as Canban-style Todo boards
- Miro to draft ingenious software architectures
- Zoom and MS Teams to engage in the next semi-productive virtual meeting
- Adobe Creative Cloud, including Photoshop, Acrobat, Lightroom, Illustrator, After Effects, etc., for all things graphics design and logos
- Amazon AWS for Cloud-Hosting some services and to securely and cheaply store terabytes in website backups
- GitKraken to brighten the mood (the entry animation is really cute) and also for visualization of project repositories

👩‍💻 We like deep-diving into planning, structuring and developing a project from the ground up. Our favorite technologies include:
- Frontend
  - Native HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP if necessary, we prefer using Ajax for backend connection
  - WordPress, Webflow
- Backend
  - Python, all day, ranging from Flask backends to complex machine learning and data science cases
  - Classic(al) ANSI-C
  - Java
- Databases
  - SQL -> MySQL, MariaDB
  - NoSQL -> PostgreSQL, Neo4j, DynamoDB, Redis
- Frameworks
  - Django (based on Python)
  - Ionic (based on TypeScript)
  
If we need to, we will also automate tedious MS Office processes using Visual Basic.

🎉 Quick fact: Having been founded on October 17th, 2017, we happily await our 5-year anniversary! Party with us!
